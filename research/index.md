We are interested in Statistical genetics and Medical genomics:

- Statistical genetics and genomics: We have developed a number of computational tools to analyze huge human genetics and genomics data. For the genetics data, we pay attention to polygenic risk score construction, gene-gene interaction identification, and genome annotation. For the genomic data, especially for single cell RNA-seq and spatially resolved transcriptomics, we focus on pipeline construction and user-friendly web server development. 

- Medical genomics: Being part of the School of Public Health at Nanjing Medical University, we have access to data and samples of several large prospective epidemiological cohorts. As the owner of UK Biobank, we focus to define the genetic and non-genetic factors of complex diseases, such as heart failure and breast cancer and explore the potential biological mechanism.
