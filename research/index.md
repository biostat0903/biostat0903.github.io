# <i class="fas fa-microscope"></i>Research

We focus on statistical genetics and genomics and molecular epidemiology.
We develop software and web server, propose reproducible pipelines and identify the factors of chronic diseases. 

We are interested in several specific research avenues:

- Methods for Genome-wide Association Study. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) collect genotype and phenotype information for a same set of individuals, and are aimed to systemically identify genetic variants that are associated with, and therefore potentially causal for the phenotypes of interest. These studies are large-scale, typically consisting of tens of thousands of individuals and millions of genetic variants, and the phenotypes are often affected by confounding factors (e.g. population stratification and individual relatedness) and sometimes by study designs (e.g. ascertainment in case-control studies). We are developing statistical methods and computational algorithms to overcome these challenges, in order to facilitate the identification of causal variants and to better model the relationship between phenotypes and genotypes. 
- Methods for Genomics Sequencing Study. Functional genomics sequencing studies collect a variety of data types by large-scale sequencing projects to provide intermediate phenotypes between genetic variants and final outcome traits (e.g. disease status). With these intermediate phenotypes, scientists hope to understand the underlying gene regulation mechanism and provide mechanistic explanations on how genetic variants affect final outcome traits. 
- Analysis for Biobank Scale Data. Biobank scale data is emering (e.g. UK Biobank, Biobank of Japan). Because of the huge number of genetic and non-genetic variables and sample size, it might give more robust result for the assication between phenotype and factors.


## How we do science

How science is performed is sometimes as important as the research topic.
Science hinges on reproducibility, and our procedure maximizes both biological and computational reproducibility.

Biology is messy, but computational biology need not be!

We pursue [open science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) to the fullest extent possible in every project.
We submit preprints of our work and subsequently publish in peer-reviewed journals to disseminate knowledge more formally around the world.
For each project, we also share project-specific github repositories (representing a lab notebook) to facilitate computational reproducibility.

We strive for creativity, integrity, inclusivity, and rigor in everything that we do.
