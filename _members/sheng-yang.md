Sheng Yang is the Principal Investigator (PI) of the Yang Lab.
He is an Assistant Professor in the Department of [Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/biochemistry) at [School of Medicine at University of Colorado Anschutz](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/).
He sets forward the lab's scientific path of inquiry, acquires funding, and establishes a lab environment where scientists of all backgrounds can flourish.
He is currently interested in developing morphology as a systems biology readout of disease states to link molecular information with higher order phenotypes in order to improve treatment decisions.
He is an optimist who believes that the next generation of biological discoveries will require lots of data, lots of compute, reproducible software, and a lot more diverse people with diverse ideas to forge an equitable and prosperous path forward for humanity.
